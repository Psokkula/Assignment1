The values for x and y are determined from the value of k in line with the limit range that was specified at the beginning of the procedure. This is done by using the value of k as a starting point.
It will be decided upon a number somewhere in the range of 2 to n times 12, and that number will be chosen at random. After that, we followed out the procedures necessary by the method for locating the nearest miss, which included calculating the equation, determining the value of the near miss, and lastly obtaining the value of the nearest miss. This process was repeated until we had the value of the nearest miss.
